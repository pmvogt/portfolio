  <h1>Howdy</h1>

  <p>I am a UI/UX designer and developer based in fabulous Las Vegas, NV. I'm currently leading user experience at
    <a href="http://pigeon.ly" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Pigeonly</a>. I'm a fan of rescue dogs, Jimmy Eat World, and the four time Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots. I've been designing web and native software for the better part of a decade, and pride myself on being a technical-minded designer with a penchant for sharp aesthetics, semantic HTML + CSS, and functional JavaScript.
